Hey get up stand up stand up for your rights
Get up stand up dont give up the fight
Get up stand up stand up for your rights
Get up stand up dont give up the fight

Preacher man dont tell me Heaven is under the earth
I know you dont know what life is really worth
Its not all that glitter is gold half the story has never been told
And now you see the light you stand up for your right
