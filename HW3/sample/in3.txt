Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our mind
Wo Have no fear for atomic energy
Cause none of thema cana stopa the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look
Yes some say its just a part of it
Weve got to fulfill the book
Wont you help to sing
These songs of freedom
Cause all I ever had
Redemption songs 
All I ever had
Redemption songs
These songs of freedom
Songs of freedom
