Old pirates yes they rob I
Sold I to the merchant ships
Minutes after they took I
From the bottomless pit
But my hand was made strong
By the hand of the Almighty
We forward in this generation
Triumphantly
Wont you help to sing
These songs of freedom
Cause all I ever have
Redemption songs
Redemption songs
