Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds
Have no fear for atomic energy
Cause none of them can stop the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look Ooh
Some say it is just a part of it
Weve got to fulfil de book

Wont you help to sing
These songs of freedom
Cause all I ever have
Redemption songs
Redemption songs
Redemption songs
